"""
UI module for CoreSpecViewer.

This package contains all Qt-based user-interface components used by the
application. It provides the full collection of page-level views that make up
the main workflow:

- RawPage:
    Tools for inspecting raw hyperspectral cubes, browsing reflectance data,
    and viewing pixel-level spectra.

- VisualisePage:
    The primary processed-data viewer. Supports false-colour display, product
    previews, cached product management, and interactive spectral inspection.

- LibraryPage:
    Spectral-library manager and correlation workspace. Enables SQLite-based
    spectral browsing, collection building, exemplar selection, and correlation
    workflows.

- HolePage:
    Full hole-level visualisation using thumbnail strips, metadata panels,
    and selectable ProcessedObjects for multi-box navigation.

- CatalogueWindow:
    A standalone file/directory browser for opening datasets outside the main
    view workflow.

All UI pages inherit from `BasePage` and integrate with the central controller
(via the ToolDispatcher) to provide a consistent set of actions across the
application. This module exposes the concrete pages so that the main application
can instantiate and register them without importing their internal details.
